Hello Bryan,

Úlfar Folk would like to invite you to our next Sumbel. It was a unanimous vote to invite you (and your partner) again. I have included the details below. I know Sundays are not ideal for you... everyone just happened to be free on a Sunday again this month instead of our usual Friday or Saturday.
Hope you can make it.

Sunday, February 23, 6:00pm.
Úlfar Folk Sumbel.

Location: 3787 Oleo Acres Road, Mountain Ranch, CA 95246

Directions: Take Hwy 49 to San Andreas. Turn onto Mountain Ranch Road.
Keep "straight" on Mountain Ranch Road/Railroad Flat Road for 15 miles.
(You will pass the tiny-tiny-town of Mountain Ranch, and the crossroads of Sheep Ranch Road and Swiss Ranch Road.)
Just after Jesus Maria Road will be Oleo Acres Road. Turn right.
We are the first house in with the goats and sheep.
